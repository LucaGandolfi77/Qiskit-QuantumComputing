Partial run log for QISKIT/Qiskit01.ipynb

Summary of outputs captured during the last headless run (partial):

--- Early info ---
Requirement already satisfied: Qiskit in ./.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (2.3.0)
Requirement already satisfied: ipywidgets in ./.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (8.1.8)

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ibm-quantum-widgets

ImportError: cannot import name 'Aer' from 'qiskit' (/workspaces/Qiskit-QuantumComputing/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qiskit/__init__.py)

--- After installing qiskit-aer and qiskit-ibm-provider and re-run ---
ImportError: cannot import name 'Aer' from 'qiskit' (same as above) -- fixed by adding fallback imports

Notes:
- The execution often fails at the environment/imports stage (missing modules or import paths differing between qiskit distributions).
- I updated the notebook to add fallbacks for Aer, BasicAer, IBMQ, and algorithms; and adjusted the QAOA/backend code to be headless-friendly.
- I also updated the runner to persist partial outputs after each executed cell, but the environment still caused a kernel death before a full run could be saved.

Next steps I can take:
- Try a re-run with increased timeouts and a clean kernel; or run only the first N cells to capture their outputs.
- Generate an executed notebook file by injecting the captured outputs into the notebook (if you'd like a formal executed .ipynb file).

Tell me which of the next steps you'd like (re-run, run first N cells, or create an executed .ipynb from this partial log).
